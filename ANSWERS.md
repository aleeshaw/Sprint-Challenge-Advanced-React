- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
* If you remove hooks from the question, Class components allow you to handle state. 

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
* Mounting: rendering your components in the DOM and setting up state.
* Updating: Handling the state and receiving props and rendering those changes in state to the DOM.
* Unmounting: No longer rendering component elements to the DOM, the component is no longer being used.


- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
* Hooks are used for handling stateful logic. Custom hooks are great for when keeping your code DRY. When your app or program handles stateful logic in the same way in multiple places, it's a good idea to build and use a custom hook rather than writing the same code mulitple times to handle your component's state.

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?
* App testing is important for many reasons. Some of these reasons include that you'll find bugs faster, they're a safety net for when you're making changes in your code, it makes for great documentation throughout your code, they encourage you to code cleaner and smarter code, they reduce your risk of your code preforming slowly
